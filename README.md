üå± Learning and Development: I'm in the process of learning React and JavaScript. In the future, I also plan to dive into Ruby. I'm always looking to broaden my horizons and skills in the programming field.

üë®‚Äçüíª Career: Junior Data Sciencist in Alchemia Labs

üöÄ Professional Goal: My current goal is to master front-end skills to become a more versatile programmer.

üì´ Contact: The best way to reach me is through LinkedIn. 

üé∏ Passions: Beyond Coding: I have a passion for playing classical guitar, being a self-taught learner. I'm also fascinated by cars, especially the SAAB brand. I am intrigued by their history and innovative solutions.

Thank you for visiting my profile. I look forward to collaborating and sharing experiences with the GitHub community!
